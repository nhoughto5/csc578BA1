Assignment one, part two is comprised of three primary components of interest.
1.) QuatCamera
2.) SplineManager
3.) Cloth

The QuatCamera is a first person camera that can be contolled by basic user inputs. The user is able to guide the view of the acmera using passive
mouse movements. The view can also be controlled use the up-down-left-right arrows wich re-orient the view using quaternion algebra. 
The position of the camera is controlled by the commonly used W-S-A-D configuration. The camera can also be shifted up and down in the upvector direction using the 
r for up and f for down. Hitting the 'Enter' key begins A SLERP from the current view of the camera to the target destination. 
V can be used to immediatly aim the camera at the small ball included in the scene. The space bar begins the set traversal for the defined by the
splines generated by the SplineManager.

The SplineManager generates a vector of Bezier splines and manages the necessary functionality to ensure a smooth transition between splines. 

The cloth is comprised of particles conjoined by springs. When the Cloth object is created an array or Particle objects is created, spaced out in an orderly fashion.
Structural, Bend and Sheer Springs are then created. The rest length of each spring is set as its initial length when created. The cloth is updated by evaluating the position of
each particle at the iteration. These positions are then used to calculate the current length of each spring. This length is then used to compute the force acting on 
each particle. The forces for each particle are then accumulated and used in conjuction with their current positions calculate the next positions using 
Verlet Integration. Each of the particles are used to construct triangles which are drawn to comprise the cloth. The intention was for each of these triangles
to be stored in a Triangle object which could then store the normal. The normal could then be used to evaluate the forces created by simulated wind.
Unfortuantely time ran out and this was not completed.
