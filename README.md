# UVic Animation Lab (CSc 473/578B)
This is where you will find all the code for the labs as well as the assignment descriptions.

## Compile Instructions
The lab(ECS 354) is already fully capable of running Atlas (the framework we will be using) as well as the labs themselves. Through Atlas, Windows and Linux are also supported. You can see the compilation instructions here:

* [Windows](https://github.com/marovira/uvic-animation/wiki/Compiling-in-Windows)
* [Linux](https://github.com/marovira/uvic-animation/wiki/Compiling-in-Linux)
* [OSX](https://github.com/marovira/uvic-animation/wiki/Compiling-in-OSX)

## Problems? Bugs? Suggestions?
Please identify where your problem/bug/suggestion is coming from. Since Atlas is maintained in a separate repo from the animation labs, it is important to know where you should open an issue to ensure it is resolved correctly.

Basically, the logic goes like this:
* If the issue is with Atlas, then open an issue [here](https://github.com/marovira/atlas/issues).
* Otherwise, you can do it [here](https://github.com/marovira/uvic-animation/issues).
